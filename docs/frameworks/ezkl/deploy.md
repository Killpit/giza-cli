# Deploy

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, any related EZKL capabilities are disabled
{% endhint %}

To deploy a model, you must first have a version of that model. If you have not yet created a version, please refer to the [versions](../../resources/versions.md) documentation.

To create a new service, users can employ the `deploy` command. This command facilitates the deployment of a machine learning service ready to accept predictions at the `/predict` endpoint, providing a straightforward method for deploying and using machine learning capabilities as an API endpoint. As we are using `EZKL` we need to add `--framework EZKL` (or `-f EZKL` for short) to the command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```shell
> giza endpoints deploy --model-id 1 --version-id 1 --framework EZKL
‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ±‚ñ± Creating endpoint!
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.498] Endpoint is successful ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.501] Endpoint created with id -> 1 ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.502] Endpoint created with endpoint URL: https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app üéâ
```
{% endcode %}

## Example Request

Now the model is available to generate predictions and generate proofs of those predictions. The schema of the data is the same as used to create the `input.json` needed to create version, for a linear regression it would be:

```json
{
  "input_data": [
    [
      0.12177091836929321,
      0.7048522233963013
    ]
  ]
}
```

To execute a prediction using **cURL**:

```sh
curl https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "input_data": [
    [
      0.12177091836929321,
      0.7048522233963013
    ]
  ]
}' | jq
```

This yields the following response:

```json
{
  "prediction": [
    [
      4.53125
    ]
  ],
  "request_id": "d0564505755944b8bef9292d980f3e27"
}
```

There is an extra args, `job_size`, that can be used in each request to specify the size of the proving job so it has more CPU and memory available to generate the proof. An example:

```sh
curl https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "input_data": [
    [
      0.12177091836929321,
      0.7048522233963013
    ]
  ],
  "job_size": "M"
}' | jq
```

Available sizes are `S`, `M`, `L,` and `XL`, each with different usage limits.

## List the proving jobs for an endpoint

To list the proving jobs for an endpoint, we can use the `list-jobs` command available for the endpoints. This command will return a list of all the proving jobs for the endpoint with the `request_id` for easier tracking.

```console
giza endpoints list-jobs --endpoint-id 1
[giza][2024-03-06 18:13:50.485] Getting jobs from endpoint 1 ‚úÖ 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_name": "proof-ezkl-20240306-979342e7",
    "size": "S",
    "status": "Completed",
    "elapsed_time": 120.,
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:12:31.295958",
    "last_update": "2024-03-06T16:14:29.952678",
    "request_id": "979342e7b94641f0a260c1997d9ccfee"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "job_name": "proof-ezkl-20240306-f6559749",
    "size": "S",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "elapsed_time": 120.0,
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:43:27.531250",
    "last_update": "2024-03-06T16:45:17.272684",
    "request_id": "f655974900d8479c9bb662a060bc1365"
  }
]
```

## List the proofs for an endpoint

To list the proofs for an endpoint, we can use the `list-proofs` command available for the endpoints. This command will return a list of all the proofs for the endpoint with the `request_id` for easier tracking.

```console
giza endpoints list-proofs --endpoint-id 1
[giza][2024-03-06 18:15:23.146] Getting proofs from endpoint 1 ‚úÖ 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_id": 1,
    "metrics": {
      "proving_time": 0.03023695945739746
    },
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:44:46.196186",
    "request_id": "979342e7b94641f0a260c1997d9ccfee"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_id": 2,
    "metrics": {
      "proving_time": 0.07637895945739746
    },
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:44:46.196186",
    "request_id": "f655974900d8479c9bb662a060bc1365"
  }
]
```

## Download the proof

We can download the proof using the `download-proof` command available for the endpoints:

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>‚ùØ giza endpoints download-proof --proof-id "d0564505755944b8bef9292d980f3e27"
</strong>[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:48.560] Getting proof from endpoint 1 ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:49.288] Proof downloaded to zk.proof ‚úÖ
</code></pre>

The `proof id` used is the `request_id` returned in the response.
