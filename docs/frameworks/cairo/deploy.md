# Deploy

To deploy a model, you must first have a version of that model. If you have not yet created a version, please refer to the [versions](../../resources/versions.md) documentation.

To create a new service, users can employ the `deploy` command. This command facilitates the deployment of a machine learning service ready to accept predictions at the `/cairo_run` endpoint, providing a straightforward method for deploying and using machine learning capabilities that can easily be consumed as and API endpoint.

```
> giza endpoints deploy --model-id 1 --version-id 1 model.sierra
‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ±‚ñ± Creating endpoint!
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.498] Endpoint is successful ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.501] Endpoint created with id -> 1 ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.502] Endpoint created with endpoint URL: https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app üéâ
```

If a model is fully compatible the sierra file is not needed and can be deployed without using it in the command:

```
> giza endpoints deploy --model-id 1 --version-id 1
‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ±‚ñ± Creating endpoint!
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.498] Endpoint is successful ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.501] Endpoint created with id -> 1 ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.502] Endpoint created with endpoint URL: https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app üéâ
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
For a partially compatible model, the sierra file must be provided, if not an error will be shown.
{% endhint %}

### Example request

Now our service is ready to accept predictions at the provided endpoint URL. To test this, we can use the `curl` command to send a POST request to the endpoint with a sample input.

```
> curl -X POST https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app/cairo_run \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "args": "[2 2] [1 2 3 4]"
         }' | jq
{
  "result": [0.1234],
  "request_id": "b14bfbcf250b404192765d9be0811c9b"
}
```

There is an extra args, `job_size`, that can be used in each request to specify the size of the proving job so it has more CPU and memory available to generate the proof. An example:

```
> curl -X POST https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app/cairo_run \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "args": "[2 2] [1 2 3 4]",
           "job_size": "M"
         }'
```

Available sizes are `S`, `M`, `L,` and `XL`, each with different usage limits.

## List the proving jobs for an endpoint

To list the proving jobs for an endpoint, we can use the `list-jobs` command available for the endpoints. This command will return a list of all the proving jobs for the endpoint with the `request_id` for easier tracking.

```console
> giza endpoints list-jobs --endpoint-id 1
[giza][2024-03-06 18:13:50.485] Getting jobs from endpoint 1 ‚úÖ 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_name": "proof-20240306-979342e7",
    "size": "S",
    "status": "Completed",
    "elapsed_time": 120.,
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:12:31.295958",
    "last_update": "2024-03-06T16:14:29.952678",
    "request_id": "979342e7b94641f0a260c1997d9ccfee"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "job_name": "proof-20240306-f6559749",
    "size": "S",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "elapsed_time": 120.0,
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:43:27.531250",
    "last_update": "2024-03-06T16:45:17.272684",
    "request_id": "f655974900d8479c9bb662a060bc1365"
  }
]
```

## List the proofs for an endpoint

To list the proofs for an endpoint, we can use the `list-proofs` command available for the endpoints. This command will return a list of all the proofs for the endpoint with the `request_id` for easier tracking.

```console
> giza endpoints list-proofs --endpoint-id 1
[giza][2024-03-06 18:15:23.146] Getting proofs from endpoint 32 ‚úÖ 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_id": 1,
    "metrics": {
      "proving_time": 0.03023695945739746
    },
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:44:46.196186",
    "request_id": "979342e7b94641f0a260c1997d9ccfee"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "job_id": 2,
    "metrics": {
      "proving_time": 0.07637895945739746
    },
    "created_date": "2024-03-06T16:44:46.196186",
    "request_id": "f655974900d8479c9bb662a060bc1365"
  }
]
```

## Verify a proof

After successfully creating a proof for your Orion Cairo model, the next step is to verify its validity. Giza offers a verification method using the `verify` command alongside the `endpoint-id` and `proof-id`.

```console
> giza endpoints verify --endpoint-id 1 --proof-id "b14bfbcf250b404192765d9be0811c9b"
[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:48.560] Verifying proof...
[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:49.288] Verification result: True
[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:49.288] Verification time: 2.363822541
```

This way we can easily and quickly verify the proof generated for our model.

## Download the proof

We can download the proof using the `download-proof` command available for the endpoints:&#x20;

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>‚ùØ giza endpoints download-proof --model-id 1 --version-id 1 --endpoint-id 1 --proof-id "b14bfbcf250b404192765d9be0811c9b"
</strong>[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:48.560] Getting proof from endpoint 1 ‚úÖ
[giza][2024-02-20 15:40:49.288] Proof downloaded to zk.proof ‚úÖ
</code></pre>

The `proof id` used is the `request_id` returned in the response.
