# Giza CLI

Welcome to Giza CLI!

This CLI provides the utilities to interact with Giza using the terminal.

## ü§î What capabilities does the CLI offer?

The CLI will serve as the main entrypoint for Giza Platform for developers. It aims to provide a tool to ease the managing of resources that exists in Giza Platform.

For now it provides the following capabilities:

* User related utilities, like `create` or `login`
* Model transpilation with `transpile`
* Create a proof from of a `casm.json` file with `prove`

In the future each new resource added to Giza will have its corresponding capability in the CLI.
