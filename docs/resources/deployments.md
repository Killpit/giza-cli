# Deployments

Deployments in our platform provide a mechanism for creating services that accept predictions via a designated endpoint. These services, based on existing platform versions, leverage Cairo under the hood to ensure provable inferences. Using the CLI, users can effortlessly deploy and retrieve information about these machine learning services.

## Deploying a model

To deploy a model, you must first have a version of that model. If you have not yet created a version, please refer to the [versions](versions.md) documentation.

To create a new service, users can employ the `deploy` command. This command facilitates the deployment of a machine learning service ready to accept predictions at the `/cairo_run` endpoint, providing a straightforward method for deploying and utilizing machine learning capabilities.

```console
> giza deployments deploy --model-id 1 --version-id 1 model.sierra
â–°â–°â–°â–°â–°â–±â–± Creating deployment!
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.498] Deployment is successful âœ…
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.501] Deployment created with id -> 1 âœ…
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.502] Deployment created with endpoint URL: https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app ðŸŽ‰
```

If a model is fully compatible the sierra file is not needed and can be deployed without using it in the command:

```
> giza deployments deploy --model-id 1 --version-id 1
â–°â–°â–°â–°â–°â–±â–± Creating deployment!
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.498] Deployment is successful âœ…
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.501] Deployment created with id -> 1 âœ…
[giza][2024-02-07 12:31:02.502] Deployment created with endpoint URL: https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app ðŸŽ‰
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
For a partially compatible model the sierra file must be provided, if not an error will be shown.
{% endhint %}

### Example request

Now our service is ready to accept predictions at the provided endpoint URL. To test this, we can use the `curl` command to send a POST request to the endpoint with a sample input.

```console
> curl -X POST https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app/cairo_run \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "args": "[\"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"4\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"]"
         }' | jq
{
  "result": [
    {
      "value": {
        "val": [
          1701737587,
          1919382893,
          1869750369,
          1852252262,
          1864395887,
          1948284015,
          1231974517
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Listing deployments

The list command is designed to retrieve information about all existing deployments. It provides an overview of the deployed machine learning services, allowing users to monitor and manage multiple deployments efficiently.

```console
giza deployments list --model-id 1 --version-id 1
[giza][2024-01-17 17:19:00.631] Listing deployments âœ… 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "uri": "https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app",
    "size": "S",
    "service_name": "deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44",
    "model_id": 1,
    "version_id": 1
  }
]
```

Executing this command will display a list of all current deployments, including relevant details such as service names, version numbers, and deployment status.

## Retrieving a deployment

For retrieving detailed information about a specific deployment, users can utilize the get command. This command allows users to query and view specific details of a single deployment, providing insights into the configuration, status, and other pertinent information.

```console
> giza deployments get --model-id 1 --version-id 1 --deployment-id 1
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "uri": "https://deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44-dagsgas-ew.a.run.app",
  "size": "S",
  "service_name": "deployment-gizabrain-38-1-53427f44",
  "model_id": 38,
  "version_id": 1
}
```
